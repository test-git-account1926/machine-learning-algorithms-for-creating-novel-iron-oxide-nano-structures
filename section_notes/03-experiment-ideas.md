# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This section outlines rigorous experimental designs following CS197 methodology to validate our core bit flips in machine learning algorithms for creating novel iron oxide nanostructures. Each experiment directly tests fundamental assumptions in the field and provides clear pathways to validate our research contributions.

Our experimental strategy focuses on three key dimensions:
1. **Predictive Synthesis Control**: Testing whether ML can systematically map synthesis parameters to target nanostructure properties
2. **Autonomous Materials Discovery**: Validating that AI systems can synthesize novel structures without prior human knowledge
3. **Real-time Process Optimization**: Demonstrating ML-guided synthesis with in-situ characterization and feedback control

## Planned Experiments
