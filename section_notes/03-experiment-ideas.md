# Experiment Ideas


## Overview

This experimental framework is designed to test our core **bit flip hypothesis**: that machine learning can systematically map synthesis parameters to iron oxide nanostructure properties, enabling predictive design of novel morphologies with targeted functionalities. Our approach builds on established literature findings while pushing beyond current limitations through integrated physics-informed ML, autonomous discovery systems, and real-time morphological control.
