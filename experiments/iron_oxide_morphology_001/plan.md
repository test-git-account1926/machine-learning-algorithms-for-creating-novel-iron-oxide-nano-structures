## Experiment Overview
**ID**: exp_iron_oxide_001  
**Title**: Physics-Informed ML for Iron Oxide Morphology Prediction  
**Date**: August 11, 2025

## Bit Flip
- **Bit**: Iron oxide morphology prediction requires extensive empirical knowledge and trial-and-error optimization
- **Flip**: Systematic ML with physics principles can predictively control morphological outcomes through thermodynamic and kinetic modeling

## Hypothesis
Physics-informed ML models incorporating Gibbs free energy, nucleation kinetics, and surface energy can achieve >85% morphology prediction accuracy and discover novel structures.

## Experimental Plan

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. **Synthetic Dataset Generation**
   - Create representative hydrothermal synthesis dataset
   - Parameters: temperature (80-220°C), pH (2-12), time (1-24h), precursor concentration (0.01-0.5M)
   - Morphologies: nanorods, cubes, spheres, flowers
   - Size: 1000 synthesis conditions

2. **Physics Feature Engineering**
   - Gibbs free energy calculations for different Fe2O3 polymorphs
   - Nucleation rate estimates using classical nucleation theory
   - Surface energy ratios for morphology prediction
   - Thermodynamic stability maps

### Phase 2: Model Development
1. **Baseline Model**: Random Forest with empirical features only
2. **Physics-Enhanced Model**: Ensemble combining:
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost with physics features
   - Simple Neural Network

3. **Feature Sets**:
   - Empirical: T, pH, time, concentration, surfactant type
   - Physics: ΔG formation, nucleation barriers, surface energies
   - Combined: Both empirical + physics features

### Phase 3: Evaluation
1. **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
2. **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified
3. **Feature importance**: SHAP analysis
4. **Target**: >85% morphology classification accuracy
