## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Predicting MRI contrast enhancement from iron oxide nanoparticles requires understanding complex relationships between nanoparticle physical properties (size, magnetic saturation, concentration) and MRI machine parameters (magnetic field strength) to optimize diagnostic applications.

### Prior Work Assumptions
1. **Empirical optimization**: MRI contrast agent design relies on trial-and-error testing
2. **Linear relationships**: Simple correlations assumed between nanoparticle properties and MRI signal
3. **Manual analysis**: MRI signal interpretation requires expert radiological knowledge
4. **Single-parameter focus**: Most studies focus on individual properties rather than multi-parameter optimization

### Key Insight
Neural networks can capture non-linear multi-parameter relationships between iron oxide nanoparticle properties and MRI relaxation rates, enabling predictive design of contrast agents with optimized imaging performance.

### Technical Approach
**Algorithm**: SA-LOOCV-GRBF (SLG) neural network with pattern optimization
- **Input parameters**: Magnetic core size, magnetic saturation (Ms), nanoparticle concentration, MRI magnetic field strength
- **Output**: Relaxation rate R2 (s⁻¹)
- **Architecture comparison**: DSLG (disperse) vs PSLG (parallel) random selection patterns
- **Optimization**: Leave-one-out cross-validation for generalization

**Data Processing**:
- Multi-parameter correlation analysis
- Sensitivity analysis for neuron number optimization
- Mean Square Error (MSE) minimization
- Pattern-based training for improved stability

### Evaluation & Results
**Performance Metrics**:
- PSLG method showed superior performance vs DSLG
- Reduced sensitivity to neuron number variations
- Lower MSE achieved through optimized architecture
- Successfully predicted MRI behavior across parameter ranges

**Key Findings**:
- Non-linear relationships dominate nanoparticle-MRI interactions
- Parallel selection pattern more stable than disperse pattern
- Multi-parameter models significantly outperform single-parameter approaches
- Predictive capability enables rational contrast agent design

### Impact & Implications
1. **Diagnostic optimization**: Enables rational design of iron oxide contrast agents
2. **Clinical translation**: Reduces time/cost for MRI contrast agent development
3. **Personalized medicine**: Allows optimization for specific imaging protocols
4. **Multi-parameter understanding**: Reveals complex property-performance relationships
