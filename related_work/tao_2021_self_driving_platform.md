## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for targeted optical properties involves navigating complex, interdependent reaction parameter spaces. Traditional approaches require extensive time, labor, and resources due to the need for systematic exploration of multiple synthesis variables.

### Prior Work Assumptions
